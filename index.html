<!--Main page paragraph with some inline CSS styling attributes -->
<p id="paragraph" style=" color:white ;font-size: large; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-justify: distribute-all-lines; 
 font-style: italic;">All Dana's Handmade are made-to-order, which allows all pieces to be created individually and with love for each customer.

    No two items will ever be exactly the same! Customized orders for specific colours, design or fit are always welcome, as the goal is for each

    customer to experience the pleasure of having something created from scratch exclusively for them.  

    This is the union of ancestral crochet technique with modern ready-to-wear designs.
    
    Dana promotes individual uniqueness, sustainability, and craftsmsanship and her clothes provide both comfort and a soft touch in a spectacular textile structure.
    
    Crochet is a manual technique which is composed of three elements, hands, hook and yarn. The construction of crochet is made stitch by stitch. Depending on the piece 
    
    the weaving process can begin either at the neckline, waist or even sideways. Each style is different but most of them are seamless.
    
    Having no formal training, Dana has learnt her craft from her grandmother's knee as a child and subsequently through hours and hours of practice and experimentation on 
    
    her own as the years progressed. To create one piece not only takes time but also the utmost concentration and care, a skill which Dana has honed and perfected over the last 16 years.
